What went well?
During this project actually creating sample webpage went surpirisingly well. I was afraid that I would not be able to get the formatting to a place where it look presentable but I accomplished something I am satisfied with. I also feel that my scope statement went much better for thisa project as I had a more clear view of what I was trying to accomplish.

What went wrong?
I was definetly very limited on time to work on this so some items feel like they might be rushed. I am satisfied with my work, but I could of made it exceptional if I had more time.

What I would do differently.
If I could do this again I would spend more time of my style sheet experimenting with differtent looks for the webpage. I am satisfied with the current outcome, but wouiuld loved to find a theme that is more thematic for my specific topic. I feel it would make the prototype look more polished.

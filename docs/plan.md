A project plan that includes a risk analysis (using the TAME framework) and a simple task schedule (Work Breakdown Structure) for your project, based on PMUPM Chapter 4.

<h3> Risk Analysis </h3>

<p> Possible risks identified are:
- Running out of time: Impact 5 X Probability 4 = 20 Risk score
- Issues formatting: Impact 4 X Probability 2 = 8 Risk score
I can TAME the risk of running out of time by starting ahead of schedule to help mitigate the risk of limited time. Also making sure I complete task that are simpler first to ensure more time for more complex issues. </p>

<h3> Work Breakdown Stucture </h3>
- Scope statement
- Plan Document
- Retrospective document
- Two HTMl pages
- README file
- Style.css file

<h1> Project Name: Zoe's Library </h1>

<h2> Project Purpose </h2>
To provide an easily accessable catolog of my personal librabry that will allow me to view information about the books I have, for example title, genre, length, and "to be read" status. This will allow me to make informed desicions about what to read next.

<h2> Description </h2>
I want to included a sorted catolog abiut all the specific about the books I own. This will display the books title, genre, author, page count, and if I have read the book or not. I will have to manually catalog and input this information by hand so it will be accessable.

<h2> Desired Results </h2>
Create a way to catalog the books I have read and those I plan to read and be able to view my options easily. This will prove useful while I no longer have to tear my bookshelf apart to find the book I want to read next.

<h2> Exclusions </h2>
This will not include pictures of the individual books or extensive descriptions of the content matter as doing so would require to much time to impliment.

The project will be approved to submit by myself upon satifactory completion, and will be evaluated after the deadline by the class Instructor.

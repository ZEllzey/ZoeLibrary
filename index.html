<h1>Zoe's Library</h1>

<p>
    Welcome to my library! This webpage is a live catalog of the books in my library and some basic info about them. 
I hope to provide insite as to the books I have chosen to own in my personal collection and maybe you will find a few books you will enjoy as I have.
</p>

<h2>
    Below is access to my digitized library. 
    Inside you will find a list of books displaying information including:
</h2>
<ul>
<li> Title </li>
<li> Genre </li>
<li> Author </li>
<li> Page count </li>
<li>and "To be read" Status</li>
</ul>
<p>
    You will soon see I have the book divided by "completed" and "To be Read", to display the books I have chosen to complete already and those whose contents I am yet to discover.
</p>
